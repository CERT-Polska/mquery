## Relevant [ursadb's documentation](https://cert-polska.github.io/ursadb)

Ursadb is the backend doing the heavy lifting for mquery. If you need to work with large
datasets, it's a very useful read. It is also a prerequisite for understanding
many things in mquery.

- [Index types](https://cert-polska.github.io/ursadb/docs/indextypes.html): Picking
    index types you need is an important decision that's hard to change later.
- [Datasets](https://cert-polska.github.io/ursadb/docs/datasets.html): Introduction to
    datasets.

    Read in case you're not sure if Ursadb can handle your collection.
- [On-disk format](https://cert-polska.github.io/ursadb/docs/ondiskformat.html):
    Ursadb index format is relatively simple - reading this may be useful for
    advanced users.
