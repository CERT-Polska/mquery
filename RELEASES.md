# Version 1.4

### Breaking changes

**[Breaking change]** mquery now users typedconfig library instead of the previous config.py file.

 - if you deployed mquery using docker (configurable by environment variables)
   then no action is required and this is backwards-compatible for you
 - if you deployed mquery natively using the default configuration, no action is required
 - finally, if you deploy mquery natively and changed the default config.py, you will have to create a mquery.ini
   file with your config. The format is very simple. Example of a complete config file (there are only 4 possible
   configuration keys supported currently. All are optional):

```
[redis]
host=localhost
port=6379

[mquery]
backend=tcp://localhost:9281
plugins=
```
